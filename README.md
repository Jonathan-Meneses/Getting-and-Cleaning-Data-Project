Jonathan Meneses
Submission for Final Project for the Coursera Course "Getting and Cleaning Data"

# Description
The script 'run_analysis.R' produces the 'tidy.txt' output from raw data pulled from [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

[Source Data for this Project](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

# Approach
This project creates a tidy data set from the following actions:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
